# Kotlin / JS try no. 104

This is my next attempt to try Kotlin inside browser, still not good (no requirejs, no amd, *.map.js
file works like it really don't want to).
But that's because I don't know anything about frontend, bootstrap, css, events, whatever.

But at least I managed to run the Intcode computer from Advent of Code 2019. 
Also learned Github Actions and Github Pages along the way.

Have fun dealing with my awesome UX skills at https://jakubgwozdz.github.io/JSTry104/cryostasis.html

Right now it only runs the game in terminal and is able to scan the output from Intcode/ASCII.
Next thing to do is to copy the code to DFS the spaceship from my solution in Java, and then maybe
solve the complete puzzle.
